# Landing Webpage 
The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/

# Overview
Build a typical website homepage with multiple, differently styled sections. Focused more on making an attractive webpage over an actual functioning homepage (i.e. no working links/buttons)

# Skills Demonstrated

- Used HTML to build the basic website, used CSS to change fonts, add backgrounds, make    borders, and round out edges
- Learnt the code for inputting a copyright symbol ( &copy; )
- Found a font-family name and applied it, using the open source Google fonts

- Utilised Flexbox:
 - Main & Cross axis placement
 - Utilising <div> containers appropriately so the positioning of elements was possible
 - Thought put into making the element layout work both in full and windowed screens

- Learned how to lookup font family names
- Learned about the "Hero Text" - a statement that appears at the top of a webpage

# Issues

Once finished, the Con1 container had a large gap next to the "placeholder for image" when viewed in fullscreen
 - Fixed by adding justify-content: space-around to the Con1 CSS
 - Working in a windowed screen, while making it easier to look at notes etc. can skew the layout of the finished webpage when looking at it in fullscreen

Writing out the full HTML, with <div> and classes defined as I go, then moving onto CSS afterward easier 
 - In previous exercises I had to edit the HTML, adding <div>s and classes so that I could use CSS Flexbox 
 - Breaking up the body into sections also helped when building the HTML
